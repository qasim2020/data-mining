# Project Option for AI programs (Only if you have NOT worked on this project before); alternatively, you as a group can work on your own project

## Gesture Classification from the Sequential Data: 

### Task 1:

1. Do the CRISP-DM analysis of the project.
2. Pre-process the attribute values so that they are in the appropriate form to be given as input for an algorithm.
3. Visualize the data with different techniques and do some descriptive analysis.

### Task 2:

1. Using the training set, train several sequential classifiers (RNNs, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU).
2. Evaluate their performance on the test set 
3. comment on the performance of the classifiers, and on the learned representations by these classifiers.
